## Description

This project uses SQL, node, and inquirer to view, edit and add to a database of employees. In the database, information like department, role, and employee are written into the data. A front end inquirer prompt is used to access this data, and queries are used to manipulate the Create, Read, Update, and Delete functions of SQL.
